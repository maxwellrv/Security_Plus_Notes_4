# Security_Plus_Notes_4

Hi everyone! During this section of my CompTIA Security+ studies I have broken into some very interesting topics. Malware is the name of the game for many threat actors today, and not only the concept of malware, but the different types and how they can have their unques effects on a users system. 

Before venturing into the world of Tech, I have always had a general (and somewhat vague) understanding of the concept of malware. When just looking at the word and trying to tear it apart, the meaning can be simple. "Mal" having a negative connotaition to something and "ware" signifying that that "something" being a type of software on a computer system. That was essentially as far as my knowledge went when it came to malware. Yes, I had obviously heard of the term "virus" and even a "worm", but I did not even truly understand what those concepts were. Also, I definitely did not know the scope of what malware was in terms of all of the different types. So with lots to learn and understand, I came to this section of my studies fully confident and full of excitement. 

As a cybersecurity practitioner, being able to have a good understanding of the different types of malware can be a huge advantage in the cat and mouse game of chasing threat actors. The more you know, the more you understand what to look for when conducting a forensic analysis on an incident. Different types malicious payloads can leave different tell tale signs for an investigator or analyst to pick up on, and that is even if you know where to look within a system or operating sytem. In addition, knowledge of malware can be utilized with security and detection engineering. An engineer must first know and understand what exactly to detect before they are able to write detections for a specific alarm. This and other topics comprised these study notes for this section. 

Other topics documented are as followed:
- Malware
